Ahhh...the wizard of Florin?,
Ahhh? So you don't remember?,
That doesn't matter (hehe) the town is in desperate need of your help,
The town hall is infested with gruntled ghouls and the people of Florin needs you to rid the town of this ghost!!,
BEWARE however (hehe) some ghosts will not be easy to negotiate and you must calm them first...,
I'll send Whisker's to show you the ropes tomorrow he'll teach you how to battle and explain the laws around here,
I'll leave this post here at the entrance to the townhall if you wish to know more about how you got here.
It's too dangerous to start right now come back tomorrow morning; the town hall is yours..
