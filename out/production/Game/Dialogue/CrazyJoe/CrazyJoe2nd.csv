££ Crazy Joe! I need that whisky bottle back... you didn’t tell me it belonged to your former captain; Jack.,
No! This is a gift for my daughter.
I promised her a gift and I shall deliver my sweet child this puppy’s soul trapped inside the whiskey bottle...,
££ That’s not yours; you have to return it now! (BATTLE),
Here ye go wee Wizard. Take this pupper back to me cap'n 'n tell 'im Joe’s sorry.
I guess th' crazy has got to me... Goodbye... scallywag.,
