Oh Wizard; it seems that I have lost my beloved friend and family… Poochie..,
££ Wizard5 ££,
Me old crewmate; fisherman joe; an' I was trekkin' along the desert to finish a quest when we got hit by a desert storm,
I’ve been searchin' the fer poochie; but I think 'e’s gone...,
££ Wizard5 ££,
Arrrr! So it been ye who took the **desert whisky!**,
££ Wizard5 ££,
I had me dog sealed inside the desert whisky so she wouldn’t be hurt by the sandstorm,
Now ye helped stole the whisky from o' Pirate Jack. You must PAY!,
££ Wizard5 ££,
Help me get my sweet Poochie back and we can forget about it,
Now go… there’s no time to waste... OR ELSE!! HAR HAR HAR!!!,
