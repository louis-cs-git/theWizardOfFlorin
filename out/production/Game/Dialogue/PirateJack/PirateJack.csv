££ What seems to be the matter?
Oh Wizard; it seems that I have lost my beloved friend and family; Poochie..,
££ Your Poochie?,
Me old crewmate; Fisherman Joe; an' I was trekkin' along the desert to finish a quest when we got hit by a desert storm,
I’ve been searchin' the fer poochie; but I think 'e’s gone...,
££ I know Joe. Fisherman Joe. I recently helped him find missing parts for his boat.,
Arrrr! So it been ye who took the **desert whisky!**,
££ I thought it was weird when he wanted the desert whisky... it wasn’t essential... but he insisted we take it,
I had me dog sealed inside the desert whisky so she wouldn’t be hurt by the sandstorm,
Now ye helped stole the whisky from o' Pirate Jack. You must PAY!,
££ What do you mean? I didn’t know it was yours...,
Help me get my sweet Poochie back and we can forget about it,
Now go; there’s no time to waste... OR ELSE!! HAR HAR HAR!!!,
