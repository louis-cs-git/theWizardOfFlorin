Ha Ha Ha… Finally; the wizard that got everyone talking has finally arrived.,
You don’t remember me do you… Well; does this ring a bell?,
Don’t you worry young wizard; she’s just in a deep sleep...,
The title “Wizard of Florin” was supposed to be mine. I worked hard as your mother’s apprentice; and I was the next best wizard in town… until you came along.,
You are her heir to be the next Great Wizard of Florin. YOU TOOK IT ALL AWAY FROM ME! But now; I will take it all back... You and your mommy can say goodbye. HA HA HA!,
How is this possible??? I made sure everything was in order and the ghosts were supposed to slow you down...I don’t understand... I guess you are truly the Great Wizard of Florin...,
