Tibbers! Tibbers! Where are you? *sob*.... I can’t seem to find the rest of toys*sob* … come back...
I can’t find my toys *sob*... mom and dad are probably waiting for me to get back but I can’t do it without my toys and Tibbers *sob*...,
I was camping with my family in the woods when I lost all my toys and that was five years ago...There are three lost toys you need to find and return to me.,
The first to find is the one I bear in mind; it stays by my side; in the house in the kitchen; and next to me in bed I lie...,
The second is an object rubbery and loud; it has no purpose except swimming about.,
The third is an instrument sometimes it's round; tap it or shake it and it'll make a sound.,
Be careful wizard... mommy never made me wait... bring me the wrong toys or you’ll make me mad!,
This is not mine!!!,
My toys! **Tibbers**! My **tambourine**; and my **rubber ducky**! Oh; Thank you! Thank you so much; Wizard!  You’ve made me so happy!,
