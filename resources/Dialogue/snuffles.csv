"Meow... Meow... Meow.. MEOWWW!,
"Whiskers? WHISKERS! Don't associate me with that fool!,
I am Whisker's evil brother and I don't think that matters anymore...,
ENOUGH! Wizard; if you want the key; you gotta fight with me!,

Please! Let me free and I'll show you where to find the key.,
Defeated; Defeated! I must pay my fee. You’ll find what you’re looking for beneath the Yarn Tree.,
