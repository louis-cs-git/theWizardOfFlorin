Out on the westward sea my young lad was lost. In his great father’s footsteps he rode; but in his boots he never returned...,
“WHY WHO...who...a soul?? A Boy? A wizard! Arrr... my woe is too deep and my mind lost its sane...,
Th' name be Fisherman Joe; but everyone calls me Crazy Joe... fer reasons unknown.
Me trusty galleon has failed me 'n has kept me away from me family fer years! Help me fix this galleon so I can be at peace wit' me family!,
Fetch me a **yarn** 'n **wooden planks** to use as a rope; some **ice** fer me whisky and a fresh bottle o' **desert whisky** to help this ole scallywag build his ship 'n set out to sea; yARRR!
AYEEEE!,
ARRR! 'Tis great. Now I can finally return back to me family 'n be at peace!; Thank ye young wizard; now LEAVE! Thus’  I needs to finish buildin' me galleon.,
