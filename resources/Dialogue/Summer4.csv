Tibbers! Tibbers! Where are you? *sob*.... I can’t seem to find the rest of toys*sob* … come back...
I can’t find my toys *sob*... mom and dad are probably waiting for me to get back but I can’t do it without my toys and Tibbers *sob*...,
I was camping with my family in the woods when I lost all my toys and that was five years ago...There are three lost toys you need to find and return to me.,
The first to find is the one in mind; it lives in a house; a kitchen; and bed; away from Goldilocks.,
The second is used to throw down the stairs; step by step; for gravity no care!,
The third is an instrument; percussion in a band? It shimmers when you shake it with your hand...,
Be careful wizard... mommy never made me wait... bring me the wrong toys or you’ll make me mad!,
This is not mine!!!,
My toys! **Tibbers**! My **tambourine**; and my **slinky**! Oh; Thank you! Thank you so much; Wizard!  You’ve made me so happy!,
